Chen , Hoi-To Wai , Ivan Tashev , Walter Kellermann , and Justin Dauwels Data Science Education: The Signal Processing Perspective I n the last decade, the signal process­ ing (SP) community has witnessed a paradigm shift from model-based to data-driven methods. Machine learn­ ing (ML)—more specifically, deep learning—methodologies are nowadays widely used in all SP fields, e.g., audio, speech, image, video, multimedia, and multimodal/multisensor processing, to name a few. Many data-driven methods also incorporate domain knowledge to improve problem modeling, especially when computational burden, training data scarceness, and memory size are important constraints. Data science (DS), as a research field, emerged from several scientific disci­ plines, namely, mathematics (mainly statistics and optimization), computer science, electrical

important constraints. Data science (DS), as a research field, emerged from several scientific disci­ plines, namely, mathematics (mainly statistics and optimization), computer science, electrical engineering (pri­ marily SP), industrial engineering, bio­ medical engineering, and information technology. Each discipline offers an in­ dependent teaching program in its core domain with a segment dedicated to DS studies. In recent years, numerous insti­ tutes worldwide have started to provide dedicated and comprehensive DS teach­ ing programs with diverse applications. Motivation and significance We believe that there is a unique SP per­ spective of DS that should be reflected in the education given to our students. Moreover, we think that now is the right time to start defining our needs and in­ spirations that will reflect the direction the field of SP will take in years to come. In this article, following a success­ ful panel at IEEE International Confer­ ence on Acoustics, Speech, and

in­ spirations that will reflect the direction the field of SP will take in years to come. In this article, following a success­ ful panel at IEEE International Confer­ ence on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2022) held in Sin­ gapore, we focus on these education aspects and draft a manifesto for an SP-oriented DS curriculum. We hope this article will encourage discussions among SP educators worldwide and pro­ mote new teaching programs in the field. DS, ML, and SP: Interrelations DS is an interdisciplinary field that can be taught from different perspectives. Indeed, DS-oriented material can be a segment of many existing teaching pro­ grams in science, technology, engineer­ ing, and mathematics. In this article, we aim at the more ambitious task of defining a complete and comprehensive teaching program in DS that takes the unique SP perspective. To put things in context, SP is con­ cerned with extracting information and knowledge from signals. Com­ mon SP tasks are

comprehensive teaching program in DS that takes the unique SP perspective. To put things in context, SP is con­ cerned with extracting information and knowledge from signals. Com­ mon SP tasks are the analysis, modi­ fication, enhancement, prediction, and synthesis of signals [see also https:// signalprocessingsociety.org/volunteers/ constitution (Article II)]. In parallel to the evolution of the SP methodology, we are witnessing a fast-growing interest in the field of ML. ML is not a new field of knowledge. Perhaps its most widely known definition dates back to 1959 (paraphrased from Arthur Samuel [1]): “Learning algorithms to build a model based on sample data, known as train­ ing data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly pro­ grammed to do so.” ML is, thus, a method of data analy­ sis that uses algorithms to enable com­ puter systems to identify patterns in data, learn from them, and make predic­ tions or decisions based on that learning. For the SP

a method of data analy­ sis that uses algorithms to enable com­ puter systems to identify patterns in data, learn from them, and make predic­ tions or decisions based on that learning. For the SP community, data come in the form of signals. While the definition of signals as the carriers of information remains unchanged, the variety of sig­ nal types is rapidly growing. Signals can be either 1D or multidimensional; can be defined over a regular grid (time or pixels) or on an irregular graph; can be packed as vectors, matrices, or higher dimensional tensors; and can represent multimodal data. As discussed, a significant compo­ nent of SP is dedicated to extracting, representing, and transforming (raw) data to information that accentuates cer­ tain properties beneficial to downstream tasks. While, traditionally, SP focuses on processing raw data that have a physi­ cal grounding on planet Earth [e.g., au­ dio, speech, radar, sonar, image, video, electrocardiogram, electroencephalo­ gram,

While, traditionally, SP focuses on processing raw data that have a physi­ cal grounding on planet Earth [e.g., au­ dio, speech, radar, sonar, image, video, electrocardiogram, electroencephalo­ gram, magnetoencephalography, and econometric data], one may not need to be limited to this standard practice.

90 IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE | November 2023 | A broader and more general definition of signals should include semantic data. Semantic information ultimately stems from the cognitive space in the human mind, which originates from neuro­ physiological activities in our brains. Cognitive neuroscience is currently not advanced enough to pinpoint how to map semantic information represented in a text to brain activation. Still, this limita­ tion does not prevent one from applying the essence of SP approaches to under­ standing, representing, and modeling text data or, more generally, semantic information. (Text is, ultimately, just a human-made representation for encod­ ing language and knowledge.) Moreover, multimodal signals are jointly analyzed and processed in some modern appli­ cations. Audiovisual SP is an excellent example of two physical signals that are jointly processed. Image captioning is a good example that involves both physical signals and semantic information and,

Chunk 7 from Data_Science_Education_The_Signal_Processing_Perspective_SP_Education.pdf:
Audiovisual SP is an excellent example of two physical signals that are jointly processed. Image captioning is a good example that involves both physical signals and semantic information and, hence, should be processed using meth­ odologies adopted from both computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) disciplines. We, therefore, claim that the ICASSP 2020 motto, “From Sensors to Infor­ mation, at the Heart of Data Science,” can be further extended to all types of data: physical, which is indeed captured by sensors, as well as cognitive and se­ mantic. The essence of the processing tasks and the underlining methods re­ main similar. The principles of DS education from SP and ML perspectives This section is dedicated to our view of the essential principles of DS educa­ tion. Among other topics, we highlight the importance of SP and ML in the DS discipline. SP and ML methods Traditionally, we may think of two com­ plementary lists of DS methods stem­ ming from the SP and ML

Chunk 8 from Data_Science_Education_The_Signal_Processing_Perspective_SP_Education.pdf:
other topics, we highlight the importance of SP and ML in the DS discipline. SP and ML methods Traditionally, we may think of two com­ plementary lists of DS methods stem­ ming from the SP and ML disciplines. A noncomprehensive list can include the following: ■ ■SP: convolution, time-frequency analysis (Fourier transform and wavelets), linear systems, state- space representations, the fusion of modalities and sensors, Wiener and Kalman filters, and graph SP. ■ ■ML: (variational) expectation maxi­ mization, deep learning, reinforce­ ment learning, end-to-end processing, attention, transformers, graphical neural networks, generative models, dimensionality reduction, kernel methods, subspace, and manifold learning. This dichotomy between the lists is rath­ er artificial. Recent trends have shown that these two paradigms are converg­ ing and are now strongly interrelated by routinely borrowing ideas and practices from each other. We believe that modern teaching pro­ grams should,

have shown that these two paradigms are converg­ ing and are now strongly interrelated by routinely borrowing ideas and practices from each other. We believe that modern teaching pro­ grams should, therefore, emphasize the SP and ML aspects of DS without sac­ rificing other essential and fundamental elements, namely, optimization, statis­ tics, linear algebra, multilinear (tensor) algebra, artificial intelligence (AI), algo­ rithms, data handling, transmission and storage, and programming skills. From the SP perspective, rigorous training in DS should bring students to think more fundamentally about where the data at hand come from; what the data points and distributions represent; and how to model, sample, represent, and visualize such information robustly so that it is insensitive to various sources and types of noise for different applica­ tions and tasks. Just as important as the technical skills, students must become aware of ethical issues related to DS, e.g., the pri­ vacy of

Chunk 10 from Data_Science_Education_The_Signal_Processing_Perspective_SP_Education.pdf:
sources and types of noise for different applica­ tions and tasks. Just as important as the technical skills, students must become aware of ethical issues related to DS, e.g., the pri­ vacy of the data, biases in collecting the data, and the implications their future techniques and developments might im­ pose on society and humanity. Teaching methodologies All modern teaching programs—and, perhaps, specifically DS teaching pro­ grams—should give special attention to teaching methodologies that can be more relevant and attractive to the younger generation of students. While we cer­ tainly do not claim that “traditional” teaching methods—namely, a teacher lecturing in front of a class—should be abandoned, we encourage educators to incorporate diverse teaching techniques in their curricula. A nonexhaustive list of teaching methodologies may include online courses, labs with interactive programming exercises, flipped class­ rooms, and hands-on experience that may involve projects and

Chunk 11 from Data_Science_Education_The_Signal_Processing_Perspective_SP_Education.pdf:
A nonexhaustive list of teaching methodologies may include online courses, labs with interactive programming exercises, flipped class­ rooms, and hands-on experience that may involve projects and teamwork. As the DS discipline is vast and cannot usu­ ally be fully covered by one institute, we encourage educators to consider student exchange programs and joint programs between universities (especially with other countries) and to include intern­ ships in the industry. Needless to say, science has no borders, and students will greatly benefit from learning in different schools and listening to many points of view from world-leading experts in their respective disciplines. Learning outcomes The graduates of the program are expect­ ed to master the theory and practice (in­ cluding programming skills) of modern and classical SP and ML tools for han­ dling various types of data, most notably, data that originate from signals. They are also expected to thoroughly understand the field’s

skills) of modern and classical SP and ML tools for han­ dling various types of data, most notably, data that originate from signals. They are also expected to thoroughly understand the field’s underlying mathematical and statistical foundations as well as related fields, e.g., data handling, storage (da­ tabases and clouds), and transmission (over the network), including reliability and privacy preservation. With rigorous training in SP and ML, graduates will be able to identify and apply the correct tools for DS problems. Graduates should specialize in several advanced topics in the general field of DS and become ac­ quainted with several domain-specific applications. Graduates will, thus, be able to address complex DS problems considering ethical aspects and the sus­ tainability of our global environment.

Readers are also referred to an interesting discussion between Prof. Alfred Hero and Prof. Anders Lindquist about the impact of ML on SP and control systems, which can be found online [7]. Several institutes worldwide already offer study programs in DS with an SP flavor. A nonexhaustive list of study programs follows. The electrical and computer engineering faculty at the University of Michigan offers an ML curriculum [8]. A new undergraduate program proposed by Bar-Ilan Univer­ sity, Israel, follows the guidelines pro­ posed in this article. This program will be opened in the 2023–2024 academic year.
