For the SP community, data come in the form of signals. While the definition of signals as the carriers of information remains unchanged, the variety of sig­ nal types is rapidly growing. Signals can be either 1D or multidimensional; can be defined over a regular grid (time or pixels) or on an irregular graph; can be packed as vectors, matrices, or higher dimensional tensors; and can represent multimodal data. As discussed, a significant compo­ nent of SP is dedicated to extracting, representing, and transforming (raw) data to information that accentuates cer­ tain properties beneficial to downstream tasks. While, traditionally, SP focuses on processing raw data that have a physi­ cal grounding on planet Earth [e.g., au­ dio, speech, radar, sonar, image, video, electrocardiogram, electroencephalo­ gram,", "score": 0.7265951633453369}, {"content": "90 IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE | November 2023 | A broader and more general definition of signals should include semantic data. Semantic information ultimately stems from the cognitive space in the human mind, which originates from neuro­ physiological activities in our brains. Cognitive neuroscience is currently not advanced enough to pinpoint how to map semantic information represented in a text to brain activation. Still, this limita­ tion does not prevent one from applying the essence of SP approaches to under­ standing, representing, and modeling text data or, more generally, semantic information. (Text is, ultimately, just a human-made representation for encod­ ing language and knowledge.) Moreover, multimodal signals are jointly analyzed and processed in some modern appli­ cations. Audiovisual SP is an excellent example of two physical signals that are jointly processed.

This includes hands-on projects, collaboration with industry partners, and addressing ethical considerations such as bias and privacy. Students should also engage in data analysis and visualization, and explore various data representations to enhance their understanding of both SP and ML techniques.\nUser:  Okay.", "results": [{"content": "and AI: introduction to DS (including the data processing cycle), meetings with industry (R&D in DS, ethics, practical and real-world problems, and needs), data analysis and visualization, data mining, data representations, and introduction to AI ■ ■SP and ML: representations and types of signals and systems, SP in the time-frequency domain (Fourier and wavelet transform, filter banks), ML and pattern recognition, statisti­ cal algorithms in SP, statistical and model-based algorithms in ML, adaptive SP, generative models, supervised and unsupervised learn­ ing, deep learning, time series and sequences analysis and processing, graphical models, and ML operations ■ ■ethics: ethical and legal aspects of DS, explainability, General Data Protection Regulation, bias, privacy, and approval processes.

Machine learn­ ing (ML)—more specifically, deep learning—methodologies are nowadays widely used in all SP fields, e.g., audio, speech, image, video, multimedia, and multimodal/multisensor processing, to name a few. Many data-driven methods also incorporate domain knowledge to improve problem modeling, especially when computational burden, training data scarceness, and memory size are important constraints. Data science (DS), as a research field, emerged from several scientific disci­ plines, namely, mathematics (mainly statistics and optimization), computer science, electrical", "score": 0.7978702783584595}, {"content": "skills) of modern and classical SP and ML tools for han­ dling various types of data, most notably, data that originate from signals. They are also expected to thoroughly understand the field’s underlying mathematical and statistical foundations as well as related fields, e.g., data handling, storage (da­ tabases and clouds), and transmission (over the network), including reliability and privacy preservation. With rigorous training in SP and ML, graduates will be able to identify and apply the correct tools for DS problems. Graduates should specialize in several advanced topics in the general field of DS and become ac­ quainted with several domain-specific applications. Graduates will, thus, be able to address complex DS problems considering ethical aspects and the sus­ tainability of our global environment.
