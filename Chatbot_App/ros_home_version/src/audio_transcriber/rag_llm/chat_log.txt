Chen , Hoi-To Wai , Ivan Tashev , Walter Kellermann , and Justin Dauwels Data Science Education: The Signal Processing Perspective I n the last decade, the signal process¬≠ ing (SP) community has witnessed a paradigm shift from model-based to data-driven methods. Machine learn¬≠ ing (ML)‚Äîmore specifically, deep learning‚Äîmethodologies are nowadays widely used in all SP fields, e.g., audio, speech, image, video, multimedia, and multimodal/multisensor processing, to name a few. Many data-driven methods also incorporate domain knowledge to improve problem modeling, especially when computational burden, training data scarceness, and memory size are important constraints. Data science (DS), as a research field, emerged from several scientific disci¬≠ plines, namely, mathematics (mainly statistics and optimization), computer science, electrical

a method of data analy¬≠ sis that uses algorithms to enable com¬≠ puter systems to identify patterns in data, learn from them, and make predic¬≠ tions or decisions based on that learning. For the SP community, data come in the form of signals. While the definition of signals as the carriers of information remains unchanged, the variety of sig¬≠ nal types is rapidly growing. Signals can be either 1D or multidimensional; can be defined over a regular grid (time or pixels) or on an irregular graph; can be packed as vectors, matrices, or higher dimensional tensors; and can represent multimodal data. As discussed, a significant compo¬≠ nent of SP is dedicated to extracting, representing, and transforming (raw) data to information that accentuates cer¬≠ tain properties beneficial to downstream tasks. While, traditionally, SP focuses on processing raw data that have a physi¬≠ cal grounding on planet Earth [e.g., au¬≠ dio, speech, radar, sonar, image, video, electrocardiogram, electroencephalo¬≠ gram,

90 IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE | November 2023 | A broader and more general definition of signals should include semantic data. Semantic information ultimately stems from the cognitive space in the human mind, which originates from neuro¬≠ physiological activities in our brains. Cognitive neuroscience is currently not advanced enough to pinpoint how to map semantic information represented in a text to brain activation. Still, this limita¬≠ tion does not prevent one from applying the essence of SP approaches to under¬≠ standing, representing, and modeling text data or, more generally, semantic information. (Text is, ultimately, just a human-made representation for encod¬≠ ing language and knowledge.) Moreover, multimodal signals are jointly analyzed and processed in some modern appli¬≠ cations. Audiovisual SP is an excellent example of two physical signals that are jointly processed. Image captioning is a good example that involves both physical signals and semantic information and,

Signal processing (SP) is the process of converting analog signals into digital signals or vice versa to analyze and manipulate them for specific tasks in the field of artificial intelligence. It encompasses various techniques such as data analysis, signal processing, machine learning, computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image processing, and many others. The goal of SP is to exploit the inherent properties of information and systems to create useful outputs that can be understood by humans or computers.

Well, let me tell you some interesting facts about volleyball:

 Volleyball is a team sport that involves two teams of eleven players each. Each player has an assigned position such as the setter (the person who passes the ball to the other team), the setter or striker (the people who hit the ball) and so on.

Players use special equipment called 'balls' which can be thrown, caught, kicked, or lobbed back and forth. The goal is to have a good shot at making the opponent miss their volleyball by hitting them with the balls.

In a match, each team gets 15 minutes of play time before the other team gets a chance to get it started. So if one team makes the last hit, they win! It's a great sport for kids and adults alike.
